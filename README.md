# Image Segmentation and Slurm

This repository contains two distinct modules illustrating key concepts in biomedical data science:

1. *ImageSegmentation* provides an introduction to a key task in image processing - the identification of boundaries between segments. Topics include basic image loading and processing and the construction, training, and application of [3D U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Publications/2016/CABR16/) neural nets for image segementation. 

2. *LearningSlurm* - a guide to the use of the (Slurm)[https://slurm.schedmd.com/] workload manager for submitting and managing of jobs on computing clusters. 

# Funding

Data science modules developed by the University of Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program with the support of the National Library of Medicine data science supplement to the University of Pittsburgh (Grant # T15LM007059-30S1).
